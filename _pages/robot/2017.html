    <!--<p>This year's challenge is called First STEAMworks. It is steampunk themed, and is focused around moving balls and gears between locations to score points. For a more detailed description, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMiNmJW7enI">the official video reveal</a>.</p>
    <p>The build season is currently going on, and our robot is still a work in progress. So far we have a shooter, gear mechanism and climber.-->
    <p>The 2017 game is proving to be one of the most challenging to date for our experienced team. FIRST STEAMWORKS aims to challenge teams to create mechanisms capable of delivering 11 inch diameter gears to human players stationed on the Jules Verne inspired airship. Teams also have the task of shooting 5 inch diameter wiffle balls to add fuel to the boiler, sending steam to fuel the airship. For a more detailed description of the game, see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMiNmJW7enI">the official video reveal</a>.</p>

    <h5>Robot Abilities</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Swerve Drive: </strong>This allows each wheel of our robot to run independently in full 360 degree motion. This gives the robot unprecedented speed and agility allowing us to deliver gears in under 15 seconds for a full journey to and from the airship while picking up and depositing a gear. </li>
        <li><strong>Ball collection/shooting apparatus: </strong>Our robot has the capacity to collect fuel from the delivery station in a top-mounted hopper leading to our side-positioned flywheel. This allows the robot to shoot 10 balls in autonomous if necessary and contribute to the alliance with the goal of flying the airship. We can hold 18 balls and are able to achieve 90% accuracy in testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Pneumatic Gear Picker: </strong>Unlike most robots, we have the ability to pick up gears off the floor in an active delivery system. Using a pneumatically actuated hook we are able to quickly collect gears deposited from the delivery station and place them on the airship’s springs. This allows up to be very versatile and collect any gears left by other teams, maximizing efficiency of the alliance.</li>
        <li><strong>Climber: </strong>Utilizing a massive gear reduction and milled slots into a rotating plate, we are able to latch onto a knot, pulling our 110 pound robot up into the scoring an onto the rising airship.</li>
    </ul>
