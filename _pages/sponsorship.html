    <p><em>Support us like this Cheval de Frise never could!</em></p>
    <p>Without our generous sponsors, we would not have the opportunity to get the most out of this wonderful program. The funds and other assistance provided by people like you helps our team purchase the tools and parts we need to build our robots, enter competitions, and order pizza during build season.</p>
    <p>Please contact us <a href="mailto:robotics1418ATSYMBOLgmailPERIODcom">by email</a> if you're interested in sponsorship! We'd love to hear from you.</p>
